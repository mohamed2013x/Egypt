			<h2>Fool && Taameya</h2>
			<p>
				Ta'ameya and ful medames, which are essentially fava beans and falafel are the original Egyptian fast foods.
				They're a staple of the Egyptian diet,
				mainly because they're filling and use ingredients that are easily accessible in the country.
				he ful is made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a qedra.
				Ta'ameya, which is an Egyptian falafel
				, is made out of crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste,
				then fried. Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
				Egypt is the actual origin of these delightful fried treats. A perfect dish for all you vegs!

			<h2>Mahshi</h2>
			<p>
    			Mahshi is one of Egypt’s most beloved traditional dishes, enjoyed by families across the country.
    			It’s a hearty meal made by stuffing vegetables like grape leaves, zucchini, peppers, or eggplants 
    			with a flavorful mix of rice, herbs, and spices.
    			The stuffed vegetables are then slowly cooked in a rich tomato sauce, giving them a tender texture 
    			and a delicious, savory taste.
    			Mahshi is often served during family gatherings, holidays, and special occasions, making it a symbol 
    			of warmth and Egyptian hospitality.
    			While many Middle Eastern countries have their own versions of stuffed vegetables, Egyptians are especially 
    			proud of their unique flavors and cooking style — truly a comfort food masterpiece!
